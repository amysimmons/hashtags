#Task

Using JavaScript, find every hashtag in a webpage and link it to the Twitter search.

The Twitter search URL is "https://twitter.com/search?q=hashtag".

A hashtag is defined as a # symbol followed by text. The text could be English, French, Chinese, Arabic, etc.

Punctuation ends the hashtag, so the text "#hashtags-are-fun" mean only "#hashtag"
should be linked.

To test this, I'll drop your script into a webpage like this:
<script async src='https://localhost/amys_script.js'></script>

And it will need to find all hashtags on a page and turn them into <a href> links.
